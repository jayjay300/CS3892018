# Game Design Projects
Here is a collection of my assignments for my Intro to game programming classes (lectures were cumulative, so the last lecture assignment and final assignment contain the work from all other assignments).

 Also included in this repo is the project files for my undergraduate research, Active Study, which was an interactive environment, designed as a VR application, to assist in the reading comprehension of children with autism. Worked in conjunction with the Undergraduate Research study department for both semesters of 2017.

All of these projects are written in Unreal engine and can be imported as such. Active Study, while designed as a VR application, is uploaded as a regular project for ease of use for any viewers of this repo.
